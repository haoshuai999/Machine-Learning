[This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites). The latest data were scraped in January 2020. 

After preprocessing the data, we tried many different models including tree-based models and linear models. After conducting a complicated grid search, we finally chose the gradient boosting model for the prediction task.

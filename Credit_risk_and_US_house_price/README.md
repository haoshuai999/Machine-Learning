## Credit risk and US house price

The first notebook (task 1) is used to predict the credit risks of people. [The German credit dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/31) in the notebook classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The data were donated by Dr. Hans Hofmann in 1994.

The second notebook (task2) is used to predict the price of house. The US housing dataset in the notebook is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata). Data analysts use this dataset to analyze and predict where property prices are moving towards. The goal of this notebook is to predict the ‘price’ column.

# Machine Learning algorithms
The problem1.py file uses perceptron learning algorithm to linearly seperate a dataset into two groups.  
The problem2.py file uses gradient descent to build a linear regression model for predicting.  
The problem3.py file process images by segmenting and grouping pixels of image.  
The visuslize.py is used to visualize the result.

## Wild Fire in Australia

This notebook is used to visualize the satellite data about the Australian wild fire. The dataset can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carlosparadis/fires-from-space-australia-and-new-zeland/data). More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-active-fire-data).

Visualizing the data with histograms, scatter plots and hexbin plots, I found that the east coast of Australia was hit hard by the wild fire.
